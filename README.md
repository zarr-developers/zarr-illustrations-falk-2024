### "Producers and consumers"

![Producers consumers](/originals/producers-consumers.jpg)

* Data producers and data consumers approach problems from different perspectives. Although their expertise is highly complementary, mutual understanding and communication is often challenging and hampers interdisciplinary collaboration.

### "Common language"

![Common language](/originals/common-language.jpg)

* Developing efficient ways to communicate (e.g. a ‘common language’) allows data producers and consumers to work closely together and acquire novel insights by solving challenges that would have been too hard for either to tackle alone.
